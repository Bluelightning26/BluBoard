### What I'd do differently next time
There were several sacrifices I had to make in the name of budgeting. Also, since this is my first full keyboard, I didn't want to overwhelm myself in the build process and avoided things that are difficult to solder. I am planning on making a v2 version of this keyboard after a few months of use, learning from the probable mistakes I made in design along the way

Nice features this would have:
- Wireless capability, BT + Dongle
- Acrylic Case
- RGB Backlit Keys
- 
(To be added to during build process along with when I use the board!)
